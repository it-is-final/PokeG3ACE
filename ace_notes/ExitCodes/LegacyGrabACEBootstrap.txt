An invisible bad egg should appear in Box 3, Slot 1, move it to Box 13, Slot 9.

To use this bootstrap for your payloads, do not modify r0 and end the payload with `BX lr`.

This bad egg will skip the next four slots after it due to limitations of the available hexadecimal values.
Do not place this bootstrap in Box 14 Slot 27, 28, 29, or 30 otherwise your box name codes will not execute properly.

The bootstrap consists of the following instructions:
```
02000000    ANDEQ r0, r0, #0x0
12000000    ANDNE r0, r0, #0x0
0A00003F    BEQ PC+0x104
1A00003F    BNE PC+0x104
```
